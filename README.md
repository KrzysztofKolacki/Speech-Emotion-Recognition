# Speech-Emotion-Recognition
Python Project â€“ Speech Emotion Recognition


A model that can recognize emotion from sound files is built using an MLPClassifier in this Python project. The libraries librosa, soundfile, and sklearn (among others) are used for this. The data is loaded, features are extracted from it, then the dataset is split into training and testing sets. Then, an MLPClassifier is initialized and the model is trained. Finally, the accuracy of the model is calculated.
